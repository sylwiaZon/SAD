This example shows how to build and deploy a Kumori Service Application composed
of two components.

The repository contains both the manifests needed to deploy the 'node-calc' Service
Application within a Kumori Platorm, and the source code (Node.js) used to build
the docker images of the two components.

Node-Calc Service Application exposes a REST API with a function to evaluate
mathematical expressions.

== Frontend component

File `manifests/components/frontend/manifest.cue` is the manifest that describes
the Frontend Component used in the Node-Calc Service Application.

Frontend doesn't evaluate the mathematical expression, but delegates the work by
resending the received expression to the destination indicated by the "endpoint"
of its configuration.

This component uses two channels:

* a server channel, called `serviceconnector`, on TCP port 8080, through which the requests
with the expressions to be evaluated are received.
* a client channel, called `evalclient`, that is its dependency to evaluate
expressions.

image:frontend.png[frontend]

This component expects this configuration:
[source,cue]
----
appconfig: {
  endpoint: "http://0.evalclient/calc" <1>
}
----
<1> endpoint allowing communication with the other component, to wich delegates
the evaluation of the mathematical expression. In this case, configuration is
closed with concrete values in the component manifests, not in the deployment
manifest.

The content of the `appconfig` key is mapped into a JSON file in the filesystem
of the underlying container:
[source,cue]
----
filesystem: [
  {
    path: "/config/config.json" <1>
    data: config.parameter.appconfig <2>
    format: "json" <3>
  }
]
----
<1> Path within the container
<2> Data to be mapped (from the config section)
<3> Type of data (json, yaml, text)

Two environment variables are mapped into the container too, to be used by the
underlying container:
[source,cue]
----
env: {
  CONFIG_FILE: value: "/config/config.json" <1>
  HTTP_SERVER_PORT_ENV: value: strconv.FormatUint(srv.server.restapi.port, 10) <2>
}
----
<1> Location of the configuration to be used
<2> TCP port on wich the web server must listen

=== Docker image

Frontend is a component executing a container based on the docker image available
in `registry.gitlab.com/kumori-systems/community/image-registry/examples/node-calc-frontend:v0.0.1`. +
The source code is available under the `code/frontend` directory of this repository.

It's a Node.js web server application that:

* HTTP web server listens on the port indicated in the `HTTP_SERVER_PORT_ENV`
environment variable

* Expects a JSON configuration file in the path indicated by the environment
variable `CONFIG_FILE`. +

* The HTTP web server implements a REST API with two functions:

** POST /calc : receives a JSON payload with a mathematical expression to be
evaluated. +

** GET /health : always responds OK

== Worker Component

File `manifests/components/worker/manifest.cue` is the manifest that describes
the Worker Component used in the Node-Calc Service Application.

Wroker is in charge of evaluate mathematical expressions.

This component uses one channel:

* a server channel, called `evalserver`, on TCP port 8080, through which the requests
with the expressions to be evaluated are received.

image:worker.png[worker]

This component expects this configuration:
[source,cue]
----
appconfig: {
  language: string | *"en" <1>
}
----
<1> language ("en" / "es") to be used in the response. The default value is "en".
    In this case, configuration is not closed with concrete values (except the
    default value) in the component manifests, so specific values may be provided
    in the deployment manifest

The content of the `appconfig` key is mapped into a JSON file in the filesystem
of the underlying container:
[source,cue]
----
filesystem: [
  {
    path: "/config/config.json" <1>
    data: config.parameter.appconfig <2>
    format: "json" <3>
  }
]
----
<1> Path within the container
<2> Data to be mapped (from the config section)
<3> Type of data (json, yaml, text)

Two environment variables are mapped into the container too, to be used by the
underlying container:
[source,cue]
----
env: {
  CONFIG_FILE: value: "/config/config.json" <1>
  HTTP_SERVER_PORT_ENV: value: strconv.FormatUint(srv.server.restapi.port, 10) <2>
}
----
<1> Location of the configuration to be used
<2> TCP port on wich the web server must listen

=== Docker image

Worker is a component using the docker image available in `registry.gitlab.com/kumori-systems/community/image-registry/examples/node-calc-worker:v0.0.1`. +
The source code is available under the `code/worker` directory of this repository.

It's a Node.js web server application that:

* HTTP web server listens on the port indicated in the `HTTP_SERVER_PORT_ENV`
environment variable

* Expects a JSON configuration file in the path indicated by the environment
variable `CONFIG_FILE`. +

* The HTTP web server implements a REST API with two functions:

** POST /calc : receives a JSON payload with a mathematical expression to be
evaluated, and evaluate it. +
Evaluation is performed by the module https://github.com/bugwheels94/math-expression-evaluator. +
Response is a JSON too, with the result of the evaluation or a description of
the error if it occurs.

** GET /health : always responds OK

== Node-Calc Service Application

File `manifests/service/manifest.cue` is the manifest that describes
the Node-Calc Kumori Service Application, with two roles:

* A Frontend role, based on the Frontend Component
* A Worker role, based on the Worker Component

The topology of this service is:

* It exposes a service server channel, called `calc`, on TCP port 80. +
* A load-balancer connector named `serviceconnector` links the `calc` service
channel with the `restapi` channel of the Frontend role.
* A load-balancer connector named `evalconnector` links the `evalclient`
channel of the Frontend Component with the `evalserver` channel of the Worker
role.

image:service.png[service]

This service expects this configuration, that will be spreaded to the roles (in
this case, only to one role):
[source,cue]
----
{
  language: string <2>
}
----
<1> language to be used in the Worker role

== Deploying the Node-Calc Service Application

To deploy the service the `kumorictl register deployment` command must be used:

[source]
----
kumorictl register deployment my.examples/calcnodedep \ <1>
  --deployment ./manifests/deployment \
  --comment "Calculator service"
----
<1> `my.examples/calcnodedep` is the name assigned to the deployed service.

To be accessible from the outside, it is necessary to create an `http-inbound`,
and link it to its service channel:

[source]
----
kumorictl register inbound my.examples/calcnodeinb \ <1>
  --domain calc-node-<cluster-name>.<cluster-reference-domain> \ <2>
  --cert cluster.core/wildcard.<cluster-reference-domain> <3>

kumorictl link my.examples/calcnodedep:calc my.examples/calcnodeinb <4>
----
<1> `my.examples/calcnodeinb` is the name assigned to the `http-inbound`
<2> Domain used to access the service. In this case, it is a domain under the
platform reference domain and (not mandatory) the domain includes the cluster name.
<3> Builtin TLS certificate related to the platform reference domain
<4> Link the the `calc` service channel with the `http-inbound`

image:deployment.png[deployment]

The deployment manifest can be adjusted before deploy the service

[source,cue]
----
configuration: {
  parameter: { <1>
    language: "en"
  }
  resource: {}
}

hsize: { <2>
  frontend: {
    $_instances: 1
  }
  worker: {
    $_instances: 2
  }
}
----
<1> Values are assigned to the configuration parameters of the service.
<2> Number of instances of each role.

== Testing the service

When an `http-inbound` is created, the platform registers its domain with the
corresponding DNS service. This operation has a certain propagation time, so the
domain may take some time to become available (this can be checked using the
`nslookup` command).

Once the domain is available, the service can be tested with:
[source]
----
curl -sS -X POST  -d '{"expr": "sin(90)*5"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://node-calc-<cluster-name>.<cluster-reference-domain>/calc  | jq .

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Expression evaluated correctly",
  "value": 5
}

curl -sS -X POST  -d '{"expr": "wrong + expression"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://node-calc-<cluster-name>.<cluster-reference-domain>/calc  | jq .

{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error evaluating expression: 'wrong + expression'",
  "value": null
}
----

NOTE: If the `http-inbound` domain is accessed before link the service with the
`http-inbound`, a `temporarily out of service` message is returned. The life-cycle
of an `http-inbound` is independent of the service to which it is linked: an
`http-inbound` can be linked successively (not simultaneously) to different
deployed services.

== Undeploying the Node-Calc Service Application

In addition to undeploy the Node-Calc Service Application, the http-inbound can
be unlinked and undeployed too.

[source]
----
kumorictl unlink my.examples/calcnodedep:calc my.examples/calcnodeinb
kumorictl unregister deployment my.examples/calcnodedep
kumorictl unregister inbound my.examples/calcnodeinb
----

NOTE: An implicit `unlink` operation is performed if the service is undeployed
with the `--force` flag: `kumorictl unlink my.examples/calcnodedep:calc my.examples/calcnodeinb --force`
